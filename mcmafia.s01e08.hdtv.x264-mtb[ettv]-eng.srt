00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,638
Go get Lyudmilla out.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,278
Get dressed. We have to go.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,398
If you chose this life, you have to
be ready to give up everything.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,758
- I'm not.
- Then that makes us even.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,238
It's good we made peace.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,798
You should be aware that I'm not
the only patron Mr Godman has.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,400
Tell your father that his friend,
Veniamin, will be happy to see him.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,000
It was a threat. It was Vadim
telling me it isn't over.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,878
I talked to my friend.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,038
And if he's willing to meet, would
you be prepared to go to Moscow?

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,840
In Moscow, they kill you!

I have to meet someone.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,998
Thank your mother for me.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,720
I'll come and see you in a few days.

20

Can I make a call first?

24
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,040
- I need to let my family know where...
- Later.

They don't have any

Let me know if you hear from him.

33
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,400
I will make some calls here.

I'm not sure what I'm doing here.

38
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
I also don't know what you do here.

39
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,718
I had some business meetings.

40
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
What business?

41
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,400
Can I speak to someone
from the British Consulate?

42
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
She was my god-daughter.

43
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
She was 21.

44
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,880
She had nothing to do
with your feud.

45
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,240
Who did you come to see?

46
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,520
- I'd like to speak to a lawyer.
- No lawyers.

47
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,160
No consulate.

48
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,200
Nobody knows you're here.

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,238
The people who invited me
to Moscow know that I'm here.

50
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,600
Just tell me
who they are, I'll inform them.

51
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm sure they'll find out
for themselves, sooner or later.

52
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,960
If something happened to
Vadim's daughter, I'm sorry.

53
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,960
But I had nothing to do with it.

54
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,080
You have until tonight...

55
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,280
...to tell me who you're here to see.

56

The airport.

62
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,598
Can I make a phone call?

63
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,398
No phone, no computer.

64
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,160
We give them to your embassy later.

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,840

You can smoke in here.

...done something.

I can't talk now.

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,760
I'll call you later.

100
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,520
Oh, thank you.

101
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,240
Your father told me to drive
you to the Ukrainian border.

102
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,520
Not yet.

103
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,078
I don't have a permanent
address right now.

104
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,558
As long as we have a contact
number, that's fine.

105
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,158
Where are you off to so soon?

106
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,078
I didn't know you guys
were coming.

107
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,758
We wanted to surprise you.

108
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,320
- Are you OK? Yeah?
- Yeah. Thank you.

109
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,200
Thanks.

110
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,080
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

111
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,958
You know Antonio, don't you?

112
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,198
No, I don't think so.

113
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,198
Antonio is Alex's friend
from Harvard.

114
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,998
- I'm sorry, Antonio...?
- Mendez.

115
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,800
Your brother has a lot of friends.

116
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,598
- Hi, I'm Femi.
- Hi, Antonio.

Nice meeting you.

118
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,438
- How's Alex?
- I don't know.

119
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,520
He's travelling.

120
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,600
Shall we grab a coffee or something?

121
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,440
No, you must be exhausted.

122
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,878
Does Alex know you're here?

123
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
We saw each other a few days ago.

124
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,318
- Well, shall we...?
- Let me know when's a good time to visit.

125
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,518
I'm so happy you're better.

126
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,560
Thank you.

127
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,278
You, too. See you soon.

128
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,998

- My pleasure.

129
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,280
- Good to meet you.
- See you.

Colonel Federov.

131
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,240
Colonel Federov!

132
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,240
Vadim.

133
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,960
Vadim.

134
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,480
My friend Oleg says you have
a proposition for me.

135
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,278
The people I represent are looking
to do business here.

136
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,118
Given their reputation, it would
have to be a very attractive offer

137
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,638
to justify the risks.

138
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,358
The business I'm talking about
is worth 300 billion a year.

139
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,518
If you'd invested in my
fund at launch, you'd have

140
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,678
doubled your money.

141
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,078
An investment with my associates
would have given you

142
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,838
a 5,000% return
over the same period.

143
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,560
The profit you're talking
about comes at a human cost.

144
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
What I'm proposing to do is increase
the profit whilst reducing the cost.

145
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,438
Right now, Vadim Kalyagin smuggles
300,000 kilos of heroin

146
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,718
into this country.

147
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,960
You have two million addicts,
50,000 deaths a year.

148
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,878
His profits are shrinking
whilst the crime rate

149
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,158
associated with them
is rising all the time.

150
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,758
I studied business
at Harvard, like you, Mr Godman.

151
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,680
How is your proposal any different?

152
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,998
My associates are only interested in
using your ports to move

153
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,720
their product into Europe.

154
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,478
In exchange for your protection...

155
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,398
...they would pay you a commission

156
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,320
and guarantee that none of
the product would be sold here.

157
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,958
The commission I'm talking
about could in turn be used to

158
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,640
boost the legal economy,
build hospitals, schools...

159
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,760
...even fight the war on crime.

160
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,000
And what would you do
about Vadim Kalyagin?

161
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,718
He won't deal with my associates.

162
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
And my associates,
they won't deal with him.

163
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,240
The mafia culture
he represents is outdated.

164
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,278
His methods are
violent, inefficient,

165
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,318
draws too much attention.

166
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,120
Attention which doesn't
reflect well on this country.

167
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,558
He lets emotion get in the way
of business,

168
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,600
which isn't good for any of us.

169
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,440
Oleg told me you could be humble
when it suited you...

170
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,840
...but ruthless, too.

171
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,600
I haven't always had a choice.

172
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,158
I'll need to discuss this
with my partners.

173
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,240
Of course.

174
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,240
How's Femi?

175
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,920
Patient.

176
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,040
Are you seeing Alex's friend?

177
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,800
Do I look like I'm in
a fit state to see anyone?

178
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,758
Sorry, sorry.

179
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,038
No. Idiot to ask.

180
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,560
He was being helpful and concerned
when I needed it.

181
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,520
I know you can't forgive my brother,
but can I please say something?

182
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
He's looked after me my whole life.

183
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,120
My mother and father, too.

184
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,960
He was trying to protect us.

185
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,358
The last thing he wanted was
something to happen to you.

186
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,680
It isn't just what happened, Katya.

187
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,840
I don't think...

188
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,560
...I know who he is any more.

189
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,480
I don't think
he even knows himself.

190
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,240
They're economists, like you.

191
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,118
You'll present your proposal,
go over the numbers,

192
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,080
and then they'll make
their decision.

193
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,720
CAR UNLOCKS

194
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,120

195
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,960

TYRES SCREECH

200
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,200
We have a lot of factions
and rivalries in this country.

201
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,758
People who do not wish us well.

202
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,040
Right now, we are on top, but it
won't always be that way.

203
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,920
Like I said,
I don't want to ruffle any feathers.

204
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,360
Then we'll meet your associates
and take it from there.

205
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,840
There's one more thing.

206
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,120
The man who shot Vadim's daughter
was arrested last night.

207
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,920
He tried to cut a deal
and implicated your father.

208
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,518
My father was 1,000 miles away.

209
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,560
Of course.

210
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,798
But for the sake of our future
partnership, it would be better

211
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,160
if you distance yourself from him.

212
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,638
Part of the reason I came here was
so that my father could return.

213
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,758
Our rivals could build a case
against him to discredit you.

214
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
That would be bad for all of us.

215
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
He's been away for
more than 15 years.

216
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,160
All he thinks about are
the mistakes he's made.

217
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,198
He doesn't want to get
back into business.

218
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,238
He just wants to come home.

219
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,200
I'm afraid it's not possible
any more.

220
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,280
I understand.

221
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680

00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
- Hello?
- Ilya.

223
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,158
This isn't what I came here for.

224
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,800
I came here to make a deal.

225
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,518
And you've made your deal.

226
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,240
Now you have to see it through.

227
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,040
Neither of us can afford
to leave Vadim alive.

228
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,280
You don't have to do this yourself.

232
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,160
Ilya?

233
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,040
Ilya?

234
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,800
Do you like football?

235
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,558
Sometimes.

236
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,040
Do you have a favourite team?

237
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,118
No.

238
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm not surprised.

239
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,238
There's a remote control.

240
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,520
You can turn it off.

241
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,678
HE SWITCHES TV OFF

242
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,840
HE GRUNTS

243
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,560
Did Ilya give you a message for me?

244
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,720
No.

245
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,480
Tell him I would do the
same thing for my family.

246
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,880
Your uncle would be so proud of you.

247
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,840
Your father, as well.

248
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,080
You did what they couldn't do.

249
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,640
I'm sorry for what happened
to your daughter.

250
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,600
I didn't know.

251
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,080
You want me to forgive you?

252
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,760
That's the only power
I've got in this world.

253
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,280
So I won't give it up.

254
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,360
How is your fiancee?

255
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,280
She's better.

256
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,800
Good.

257
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,640
You still love her?

258
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,320
I've told you before...

259
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,680
...if you choose this life...

260
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,800
...if you want her to be safe...

261
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,880
...you'll have to give her up.

262
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,840
Your family, too.

263
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,720
Everyone you love.

264
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,680
Everyone.

265
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,080
You'll be alone...

266
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,680
...every single day.

267
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,280
Until someone comes to put
you out of your misery.

268
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,760
My wallet.

269
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,560
There's a picture of my daughter
I would love to have.

270
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,840
HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH

271
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,080
GUNSHOT

272
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,040
Katya told me Alex went to Russia?

273
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,240
He's safe now.

274
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,800
Will you go back, too?

275
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,680
What for? This is our home now.

276
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,998
I love my country, but I don't
belong there any more.

277
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,558
Anyway, the whole world
is the same now.

278
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,960
Gucci here, Gucci there.

279
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,800
I hope we can still see each other.

280
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,880
Even if Alex and I aren't together.

281
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,480
Katya told me about your baby.

282
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,920
Our baby.

283
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,720
You know someone is a part of the
family when you feel their pain.

284
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,200
You're like my daughter now.

285
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,998
And who knows? Dmitri and I argue
every day for 40 years

286
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,640
and I still forgive him.

287
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,040
He's a good boy.

288
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,520
I'm biased, I know.

289
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,320
But he's my son.

290
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,800
When will you come back?

291
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,960
I don't know.
It depends what he wants to do.

292
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,880
Why what <i>he</i> wants?
You can decide, too.

293
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,840
I made you something.

294
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,960
I don't know what is, either.

295
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,238
My colleagues and I have discussed
Mr Godman's proposal

296
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,880
and he has our full confidence.

297
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,118
With your permission,
I'm going to withdraw

298
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,680
and leave our side
of the negotiations to him.

299
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,520
Thanks.

300
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,318
These terms are unacceptable.

301
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,078
Those are our terms.

302
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,320
Your terms?

303
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,960
We sent you here to arrange
an introduction, that's all.

304
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,560
Antonio.

305
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,278
We did you a favour.

306
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,920
Who the hell do you think you are?

307
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,118
Forgive me, Mr Alegre, but it might
be simpler if you and I

308
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,760
discussed these matters alone.

309
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,840
We both speak for our
respective sides.

310
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,958
In return for an open door
and protection for your shipments,

311
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,920
we'd ask for a 50% split
of every consignment.

312
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,678
We would have no involvement in any
business from your other routes,

313
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,678
but we would control
all distribution

314
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,038
that passes through our territory.

315
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,880
50%, it's impossible...

316
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,798
...and we have no interest
in being wholesalers.

317
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,518
Getting your product into Europe is
the hardest part of your business.

318
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,638
The Dutch and Spanish ports you have
used are no longer viable and you

319
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,000
haven't managed to gain a foothold
in West Africa, unlike your rivals.

320
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,998
Through the networks and routes
that I will inherit,

321
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,438
I'll manage the sale
and distribution of your product

322
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,320
in any territories
that don't conflict with your own.

323
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,158
In return, I'd ask that you don't
interfere with my contacts

324
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,280
or encroach on any territory
where I represent you.

325
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,920
I work on your behalf.

326
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,960
